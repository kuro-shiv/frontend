       <h3><center><u><b>ABOUT ANIME</b></u></center></h3>
       <h4> Anime, as a distinct form of animation, has a rich history that dates back to the early 20th century. The evolution of anime involves various influences, cultural shifts, and the contributions of many pioneers in the field. Here's a brief overview of the history of anime:</h4>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
    <strong> Early Years (1917-1930s):</strong><br>

The earliest known Japanese animation dates back to 1917 with works like "Namakura Gatana" (An Obtuse Sword) and "Katsudō Shashin" (Moving Picture). These were silent, short films.
The influence of Western animation, especially Disney, was notable during this period.
</li><br>
<li>
    <strong>World War II and Propaganda(1930s-1945): </strong><br>

During World War II, the Japanese government used animation for propaganda purposes. Animated films were created to promote nationalism and support the war effort.
</li><br>
<li>
    <strong> Post-War Era (1945-1960s):
    </strong><br>

After World War II, Japan experienced a period of reconstruction. Animated works became more diverse, and the industry started to recover.
Osamu Tezuka, often referred to as the "God of Manga," played a crucial role. He created iconic characters like Astro Boy (Tetsuwan Atom) in the early 1960s, contributing to the popularization of anime.
</li><br>
<li>
    <strong> Television Era (1960s-1970s):</strong><br>

The 1960s saw the emergence of anime on television. Series like "Astro Boy," "Speed Racer" (Mach GoGoGo), and "Gigantor" (Tetsujin 28-go) gained international recognition.
The 1970s brought the rise of mecha anime with influential series like "Mobile Suit Gundam."
</li><br>
<li>
    <strong>  1980s-1990s: Golden Age and International Expansion:</strong><br>

The 1980s marked a period of creativity and experimentation. Genres diversified, and successful franchises like "Dragon Ball" and "Naruto" began.
Studio Ghibli, founded by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, produced critically acclaimed films such as "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Spirited Away."
International interest in anime grew, and titles like "Akira" and "Ghost in the Shell" gained popularity outside Japan.
</li><br>
<li>
    <strong> Digital Age and Globalization (2000s-Present):</strong><br>

The 2000s witnessed the digital transformation of the anime industry. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) became more prevalent.
Streaming services like Crunchyroll and Funimation made anime accessible to a global audience.
Anime continues to thrive globally, with a diverse range of genres and an ever-expanding fan base.
</li><br>
</ol>
Throughout its history, anime has evolved from traditional hand-drawn animation to a blend of traditional and digital techniques. It has become a cultural phenomenon with a significant impact on global entertainment. The creativity and storytelling in anime continue to captivate audiences of all ages worldwide.</p>

          <p><b> Namakura Gatana (lit. 'dull-edged sword'; gatana is rendaku of katana) is a short comedic jidaigeki about a dim-witted self-appointed samurai and his worn-down sword which turns completely useless as he tries to fight even the weakest opponents. The samurai, trying to figure out why his old sword cannot cut anyone he strikes, tries desperately to attack random townspeople who defend themselves and knock him out.
